Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows machines to break down and interpret human language. It’s at the core of tools we use every day – from translation software, chatbots, spam filters, and search engines, to grammar correction software, voice assistants, and social media monitoring tools.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that makes human language intelligible to machines. NLP combines the power of linguistics and computer science to study the rules and structure of language, and create intelligent systems (run on machine learning and NLP algorithms) capable of understanding, analyzing, and extracting meaning from text and speech.

NLP combines the power of linguistics and computer science to study the rules and structure of language, and create intelligent systems (run on machine learning and NLP algorithms) capable of understanding, analyzing, and extracting meaning from text and speech.

NLP is used to understand the structure and meaning of human language by analyzing different aspects like syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and morphology. Then, computer science transforms this linguistic knowledge into rule-based, machine learning algorithms that can solve specific problems and perform desired tasks.

Take Gmail, for example. Emails are automatically categorized as Promotions, Social, Primary, or Spam, thanks to an NLP task called keyword extraction. By “reading” words in subject lines and associating them with predetermined tags, machines automatically learn which category to assign emails.

## NLP Benefits
There are many benefits of NLP, but here are just a few top-level benefits that will help your business become more competitive:

Perform large-scale analysis. Natural Language Processing helps machines automatically understand and analyze huge amounts of unstructured text data, like social media comments, customer support tickets, online reviews, news reports, and more.
Automate processes in real-time. Natural language processing tools can help machines learn to sort and route information with little to no human interaction – quickly, efficiently, accurately, and around the clock.
Tailor NLP tools to your industry. Natural language processing algorithms can be tailored to your needs and criteria, like complex, industry-specific language – even sarcasm and misused words.
## How Does Natural Language Processing Work?
Using text vectorization, NLP tools transform text into something a machine can understand, then machine learning algorithms are fed training data and expected outputs (tags) to train machines to make associations between a particular input and its corresponding output. Machines then use statistical analysis methods to build their own “knowledge bank” and discern which features best represent the texts, before making predictions for unseen data (new texts):

Machine learning process, from training to prediction
Ultimately, the more data these NLP algorithms are fed, the more accurate the text analysis models will be.

Sentiment analysis (seen in the above chart) is one of the most popular NLP tasks, where machine learning models are trained to classify text by polarity of opinion (positive, negative, neutral, and everywhere in between).
